  abstract = "The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a
              significant threat to global health. More and more
              multi-drug-resistant bacterial strains cause life-threatening
              infections and the death of thousands of people each year. Beyond
              disease control animals are often given antibiotics for growth
              promotion or increased feed efficiency, which further increase
              the chance of the development of multi-resistant strains. After
              the consumption of unprocessed animal products, these strains may
              meet the human bacteriota. Among the foodborne and the human
              populations, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) may be shared
              by horizontal gene transfer. This study aims to test the presence
              of antimicrobial resistance genes in milk metagenome, investigate
              their genetic position and their linkage to mobile genetic
              elements. We have analyzed raw milk samples from public markets
              sold for human consumption. The milk samples contained genetic
              material from various bacterial species and the in-depth analysis
              uncovered the presence of several antimicrobial resistance genes.
              The samples contained complete ARGs influencing the effectiveness
              of acridine dye, cephalosporin, cephamycin, fluoroquinolone,
              penam, peptide antibiotics and tetracycline. One of the ARGs, PC1
              beta-lactamase may also be a mobile element that facilitates the

  abstract = "Antibiotic resistance is a natural feature of diverse microbial
              ecosystems. Although recent studies of the antibiotic resistome
              have highlighted barriers to the horizontal transfer of
              antibiotic resistance genes between habitats, the rapid global
              spread of genes that confer resistance to carbapenem, colistin
              and quinolone antibiotics illustrates the dire clinical and
              societal consequences of such events. Over time, the study of
              antibiotic resistance has grown from focusing on single
              pathogenic organisms in axenic culture to studying antibiotic
              resistance in pathogenic, commensal and environmental bacteria at
              the level of microbial communities. As the study of antibiotic
              resistance advances, it is important to incorporate this
              comprehensive approach to better inform global antibiotic
              resistance surveillance and antibiotic development. It is
              increasingly becoming apparent that although not all resistance

  abstract = "Background Antibiotic resistance, mainly due to imprudent use of
              antibiotics in agriculture, environment, animal and human
              medicine, has been widely recognized as one of the main global
              health concerns, threatening food security, and human and animal
              health, causing considerable economic losses. Scope and approach
              We summarize the state of the art in antibiotic resistant
              foodborne bacteria and related reservoirs, some actions to
              overcome this threat, and the future perspectives in the field.
              Key findings and conclusions Food and food production may be a
              vehicle of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic
              resistance genes to humans that have a public health impact.
              Mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, have the
              ability to form hybrid elements interplaying with or from the
              environment and foodborne bacteria. These genetic structures are
              able to encode for resistance for many antibiotics, namely those
              that are last resort treatments for patients infected with
              multidrug resistant bacteria. Information, education and
              training, surveillance, monitoring, record-keeping, reduction of
              infection, legislation, optimization and reduced antibiotic use,
              and sustainable investment for alternatives, are important
              actions to bring antibiotic resistant foodborne bacteria under
              control. Omics technologies such as genomics, metagenomics and
              transcriptomics, are valuable tools for surveillance and control
              of antibiotic resistance in different One Health settings,
              notably with respect to the selection, dissemination, and
              distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria in food, as well as
              to unravel the antibiotic resistance mechanism involved. In the
              future metatranscriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are
              expected to enlarge next-generation-sequencing tools to
              strengthen control of antibiotic resistance in food.",

              reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human
              health and animal production. There is still limiting data on
              both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of
              resistance as well as impact on human health. However, in recent
              years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant
              Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli
              and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock
              reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was
              estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance
              in Campylobacter and Salmonella. Studies have indicated that
              there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular

              fears expressed that we shortly will run out of antibiotics. In
              reality, the picture is more mixed, improving against some
              pathogens but worsening against others. Against
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--the highest
              profile pathogen--the range of treatment options is expanding,
              with daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline all launched, and
              telavancin, ceftobiprole, ceftaroline and dalbavancin
              anticipated. There is a greater problem with enterococci,
              especially if, as in endocarditis, bactericidal activity is
              needed and the isolate has high-level aminoglycoside resistance;
              nevertheless, daptomycin, telavancin and razupenem all offer
              cidal potential. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the rapid and
              disturbing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC
              enzymes and quinolone resistance is forcing increased reliance on
              carbapenems, with resistance to these slowly accumulating via the
              spread of metallo-, KPC and OXA-48 beta-lactamases. Future
              options overcoming some of these mechanisms include various novel
              beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but none of these
              overcomes all the carbapenemase types now circulating.
              Multiresistance that includes carbapenems is much commoner in
              non-fermenters than in the Enterobacteriaceae, depending mostly
              on OXA carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii and on
              combinations of chromosomal mutation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
              No agent in advanced development has much to offer here, though
              there is interest in modified, less-toxic, polymyxin derivatives

              activity against A. baumannii and members of the Burkholderia

              antibiotic resistance. Variations in antibiotic resistance across
              countries are attributable, in part, to different volumes and
              patterns for antibiotic consumption. We aimed to assess
              variations in consumption to assist monitoring of the rise of
              resistance and development of rational-use policies and to
              provide a baseline for future assessment. METHODS: With use of
              sales data for retail and hospital pharmacies from the IMS Health
              MIDAS database, we reviewed trends for consumption of standard
              units of antibiotics between 2000 and 2010 for 71 countries. We
              used compound annual growth rates to assess temporal differences
              in consumption for each country and Fourier series and regression
              methods to assess seasonal differences in consumption in 63 of
              the countries. FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2010, consumption of
              antibiotic drugs increased by 36\% (from 54 083 964 813 standard
              units to 73 620 748 816 standard units). Brazil, Russia, India,
              China, and South Africa accounted for 76\% of this increase. In
              most countries, antibiotic consumption varied significantly with
              season. There was increased consumption of carbapenems (45\%) and
              polymixins (13\%), two last-resort classes of antibiotic drugs.
              INTERPRETATION: The rise of antibiotic consumption and the
              increase in use of last-resort antibiotic drugs raises serious
              concerns for public health. Appropriate use of antibiotics in
              developing countries should be encouraged. However, to prevent a

              countries with large populations and to preserve antibiotic
              efficacy worldwide, programmes that promote rational use through

              can explore the taxonomic profile and the function of unknown
              microorganisms in samples, and complement the shortage of
              amplicon sequencing. Binning assembled sequences into individual
              groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a
              major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and
              unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in
              binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters
              contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods
              without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot
              of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome
              tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In
              this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12
              original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing
              the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic
              datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. RESULTS: For
              chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat,
              Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner,
              and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the
              most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2
              achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (>
              0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among
              original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had
              similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity.

              infections and the antibiotic resistance genes acquired by human
              pathogens each have an environmental origin. Recent work
              indicates that the function of these elements in their
              environmental reservoirs may be very distinct from the
              ``weapon-shield'' role they play in clinical settings. Changes in
              natural ecosystems, including the release of large amounts of
              antimicrobials, might alter the population dynamics of
              microorganisms, including selection of resistance, with
              consequences for human health that are difficult to predict.",

  abstract = "Filoviruses such as Ebola virus continue to pose a substantial
              health risk to humans. Advances in the sequencing and functional
              characterization of both pathogen and host genomes have provided
              a wealth of knowledge to clinicians, epidemiologists and public
              health responders during outbreaks of high-consequence viral
              disease. Here, we describe how genomics has been historically
              used to investigate Ebola virus disease outbreaks and how new
              technologies allow for rapid, large-scale data generation at the
              point of care. We highlight how genomics extends beyond
              consensus-level sequencing of the virus to include intra-host
              viral transcriptomics and the characterization of host responses
              in acute and persistently infected patients. Similar genomics
              techniques can also be applied to the characterization of
              non-human primate animal models and to known natural reservoirs
              of filoviruses, and metagenomic sequencing can be the key to the
              discovery of novel filoviruses. Finally, we outline the
              importance of reverse genetics systems that can swiftly
              characterize filoviruses as soon as their genome sequences are
              available.",
