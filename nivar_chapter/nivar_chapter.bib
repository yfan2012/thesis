              to Candida glabrata, was described following its isolation from
              three patients in a single Spanish hospital. Between 2005 and
              2006, 16 fungal isolates with phenotypic similarities to C.
              nivariensis were submitted to the United Kingdom Mycology
              Reference Laboratory for identification. The strains originated
              from various clinical specimens, including deep, usually sterile
              sites, from patients at 12 different hospitals in the United
              Kingdom. PCR amplification and sequencing of the D1D2 and
              internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) regions of the nuclear
              ribosomal gene cassette confirmed that these isolates from the
              United Kingdom are genetically identical to C. nivariensis.
              Biochemically, C. glabrata and C. nivariensis are distinguished
              by their differential abilities to assimilate trehalose. However,
              in contrast to the original published findings, we found that C.
              glabrata isolates, but not C. nivariensis isolates, are capable
              of assimilating this substrate. Antifungal susceptibility tests
              revealed that C. nivariensis isolates are less susceptible than
              C. glabrata isolates to itraconazole, fluconazole, and
              voriconazole and to have significantly higher flucytosine MICs
              than C. glabrata strains. Finally, C. nivariensis could be
              rapidly distinguished from the other common pathogenic fungus
              species by pyrosequencing of the ITS2 region. In the light of
              these data, we believe that C. nivariensis should be regarded as

  abstract = "The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is capable of
              adhering to the oral mucosa despite forces created by salivary
              flow. Although many fungal adhesion proteins have been
              identified, less is known about the temporal development of cell
              adhesion and biofilm growth in a flow environment. In this study,
              we use a flow system with real-time imaging of C. albicans cells
              as they adhere and grow. Rates of cell attachment and dispersion
              of C. albicans knockout strains of putative adhesins,
              transcription factors, and deletions with a hyperfilamentous
              phenotype were quantified during 18 h of biofilm development.
              Cell adhesion under flow is a multi-phase process initiated with
              cell rolling, then an initial firm attachment to the substrate
              occurs. After attachment, cells enter a growth phase where cells
              either commit to adherence or disperse. C. albicans $\Delta$eap1,
              $\Delta$hwp2, $\Delta$hyr1, and $\Delta$ihd1 cells had
              significantly reduced initial attachment and subsequent adhesion,
              while $\Delta$als1/$\Delta$als3 had no change in initial
              attachment but reduced adhesion maintenance. WT cells had
              increased adhesion during the late growth phase when hyphae were
              more highly expressed. Hyperfilamentous strains had 10-fold
              higher total biofilm growth, a result of significantly reduced
              detachment rates, showing that hyphal morphogenesis is important
              for adhesion maintenance in the developing biofilm. The rate of
              C. albicans biomass dispersion was most important for determining
              the density of the mature biomass. Adhesion maintenance was
              mediated in part by Ywp1, a protein previously thought to
              regulate dispersion, thus it functions as an adhesion maintenance
              protein in C. albicans.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Several eukaryotic proteins associated to the
              extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane carry a
              Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is linked to the
              C-terminal residue after a proteolytic cleavage occurring at the
              so called omega-site. Computational methods were developed to
              discriminate proteins that undergo this post-translational
              modification starting from their aminoacidic sequences. However
              more accurate methods are needed for a reliable annotation of
              whole proteomes. RESULTS: Here we present PredGPI, a prediction
              method that, by coupling a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a
              Support Vector Machine (SVM), is able to efficiently predict both
              the presence of the GPI-anchor and the position of the
              omega-site. PredGPI is trained on a non-redundant dataset of
              experimentally characterized GPI-anchored proteins whose
              annotation was carefully checked in the literature. CONCLUSION:
              PredGPI outperforms all the other previously described methods
              and is able to correctly replicate the results of previously
              published high-throughput experiments. PredGPI reaches a lower
              rate of false positive predictions with respect to other

              and is of relevance for adaptation to environmental change, but
              the extent of such variability in natural populations is still
              poorly understood. For example, selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              strains are variable at the ploidy level, have gene
              amplifications, changes in chromosome copy number, and gross
              chromosomal rearrangements. This suggests that genome plasticity
              provides important genetic diversity upon which natural selection
              mechanisms can operate. RESULTS: In this study, we have used
              wild-type S. cerevisiae (yeast) strains to investigate genome
              variation in natural and artificial environments. We have used
              comparative genome hybridization on array (aCGH) to characterize
              the genome variability of 16 yeast strains, of laboratory and
              commercial origin, isolated from vineyards and wine cellars, and
              from opportunistic human infections. Interestingly, sub-telomeric
              instability was associated with the clinical phenotype, while Ty
              element insertion regions determined genomic differences of
              natural wine fermentation strains. Copy number depletion of ASP3
              and YRF1 genes was found in all wild-type strains. Other gene
              families involved in transmembrane transport, sugar and alcohol
              metabolism or drug resistance had copy number changes, which also
              distinguished wine from clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: We have
              isolated and genotyped more than 1000 yeast strains from natural
              environments and carried out an aCGH analysis of 16 strains
              representative of distinct genotype clusters. Important genomic
              variability was identified between these strains, in particular
              in sub-telomeric regions and in Ty-element insertion sites,
              suggesting that this type of genome variability is the main
              source of genetic diversity in natural populations of yeast. The
              data highlights the usefulness of yeast as a model system to
              unravel intraspecific natural genome diversity and to elucidate
              how natural selection shapes the yeast genome.",

  abstract = "Chromosomal rearrangements are a major driver of eukaryotic
              genome evolution, affecting speciation, pathogenicity and cancer
              progression. Changes in chromosome structure are often initiated
              by mis-repair of double-strand breaks in the DNA. Mis-repair is
              particularly likely when telomeres are lost or when dispersed
              repeats misalign during crossing-over. Fungi carry highly
              polymorphic chromosomal complements showing substantial variation
              in chromosome length and number. The mechanisms driving
              chromosome polymorphism in fungi are poorly understood. We aimed
              to identify mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in the
              fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We combined
              population genomic resequencing and chromosomal segment PCR
              assays with electrophoretic karyotyping and resequencing of
              parents and offspring from experimental crosses to show that this
              pathogen harbors a highly diverse complement of accessory
              chromosomes that exhibits strong global geographic
              differentiation in numbers and lengths of chromosomes. Homologous
              chromosomes carried highly differentiated gene contents due to
              numerous insertions and deletions. The largest accessory
              chromosome recently doubled in length through insertions totaling
              380 kb. Based on comparative genomics, we identified the precise
              breakpoint locations of these insertions. Nondisjunction during
              meiosis led to chromosome losses in progeny of three different
              crosses. We showed that a new accessory chromosome emerged in two
              viable offspring through a fusion between sister chromatids. Such
              chromosome fusion is likely to initiate a breakage-fusion-bridge
              (BFB) cycle that can rapidly degenerate chromosomal structure. We
              suggest that the accessory chromosomes of Z. tritici originated
              mainly from ancient core chromosomes through a degeneration
              process that included BFB cycles, nondisjunction and mutational
              decay of duplicated sequences. The rapidly evolving accessory

              scaffolding. MeDuSa exploits information obtained from a set of
              (draft or closed) genomes from related organisms to determine the
              correct order and orientation of the contigs. MeDuSa formalizes

  abstract = "Subtelomeric regions of the genome are notable for high rates of
              sequence evolution and rapid gene turnover. Evidence of
              subtelomeric evolution has relied heavily on comparisons of
              historical evolutionary patterns to infer trends and frequencies
              of these events. Here, we describe evolution of the subtelomeric
              TLO gene family in Candida albicans during laboratory passaging
              for over 4000 generations. C. albicans is a commensal and
              opportunistic pathogen of humans and the TLO gene family encodes
              a subunit of the Mediator complex that regulates transcription
              and affects a range of virulence factors. We identified 16
              distinct subtelomeric recombination events that altered the TLO
              repertoire. Ectopic recombination between subtelomeres on
              different chromosome ends occurred approximately once per 5000
              generations and was often followed by loss of heterozygosity,
              resulting in the complete loss of one TLO gene sequence with
              expansion of another. In one case, recombination within TLO genes
              produced a novel TLO gene sequence. TLO copy number changes were
              biased, with some TLOs preferentially being copied to novel
              chromosome arms and other TLO genes being frequently lost. The
              majority of these nonreciprocal recombination events occurred
              either within the 3' end of the TLO coding sequence or within a
              conserved 50-bp sequence element centromere-proximal to TLO
              coding sequence. Thus, subtelomeric recombination is a rapid
              mechanism of generating genotypic diversity through alterations
              in the number and sequence of related gene family members.",

              Although the mechanisms underlying virulence and drug resistance

              good understanding of how this yeast adapts during the course of

              genomic plasticity of C. glabrata plays a role during infection,

              clonal population. To shed light onto the genomic variation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Candida glabrata follows C. albicans as the second or
              third most prevalent cause of candidemia worldwide. These two
              pathogenic yeasts are distantly related, C. glabrata being part
              of the Nakaseomyces, a group more closely related to
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although C. glabrata was thought to be
              the only pathogenic Nakaseomyces, two new pathogens have recently
              been described within this group: C. nivariensis and C.
              bracarensis. To gain insight into the genomic changes underlying
              the emergence of virulence, we sequenced the genomes of these
              two, and three other non-pathogenic Nakaseomyces, and compared
              them to other sequenced yeasts. RESULTS: Our results indicate
              that the two new pathogens are more closely related to the
              non-pathogenic N. delphensis than to C. glabrata. We uncover
              duplications and accelerated evolution that specifically affected
              genes in the lineage preceding the group containing N. delphensis
              and the three pathogens, which may provide clues to the higher
              propensity of this group to infect humans. Finally, the number of
              Epa-like adhesins is specifically enriched in the pathogens,
              particularly in C. glabrata. CONCLUSIONS: Remarkably, some
              features thought to be the result of adaptation of C. glabrata to
              a pathogenic lifestyle, are present throughout the Nakaseomyces,
              indicating these are rather ancient adaptations to other
              environments. Phylogeny suggests that human pathogenesis evolved
              several times, independently within the clade. The expansion of
              the EPA gene family in pathogens establishes an evolutionary link
              between adhesion and virulence phenotypes. Our analyses thus shed
              light onto the relationships between virulence and the recent

              importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford
              Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Here, we examine the performance of
              different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of
              bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus
              basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional
              aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset,
              using a larger neural network model and improving consensus
              basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with
              Nanopolish. RESULTS: Training basecallers on taxon-specific data
              results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due
              to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural
              network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but
              at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing')
              with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in
              basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on
              post-polish accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Basecalling accuracy has seen
              significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current
              version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with
              good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is

              Candida glabrata's ability to adhere to host tissue is mediated
              by GPI-anchored cell wall proteins (GPI-CWPs); the corresponding
              genes contain long tandem repeat regions. These repeat regions
              resulted in assembly errors in the reference genome. Here, we
              performed a de novo assembly of the C. glabrata type strain
              CBS138 using long single-molecule real-time reads, with short
              read sequences (Illumina) for refinement, and constructed
              telomere-to-telomere assemblies of all 13 chromosomes. Our
              assembly has excellent agreement overall with the current
              reference genome, but we made substantial corrections within
              tandem repeat regions. Specifically, we removed 62 genes of which
              45 were scrambled due to misassembly in the reference. We
              annotated 31 novel ORFs of which 24 ORFs are GPI-CWPs. In
              addition, we corrected the tandem repeat structure of an
              additional 21 genes. Our corrections to the genome were
              substantial, with the length of new genes and tandem repeat
              corrections amounting to approximately 3.8\% of the ORFeome
              length. As most corrections were within the coding regions of

              factors. Here, we consider three characteristics that confer
              extraordinary advantages to C. glabrata within the host. (1) C.
              glabrata has a large number of genes encoding for adhesins most
              of which are localized at subtelomeric regions. The number and
              sequence of these genes varies substantially depending on the

              plasticity; (2) The largest family of CWPs (cell wall proteins)
              is the EPA (epithelial adhesin) family of adhesins. Epa1 is the
              major adhesin and mediates adherence to epithelial, endothelial
              and immune cells. Several layers of regulation like subtelomeric
              silencing, cis-acting regulatory regions, activators, nutritional
              signaling, and stress conditions tightly regulate the expression
              of many adhesin-encoding genes in C. glabrata, while many others

              acquired resistance to xenobiotics and increased adherence; (3)
              Other subfamilies of adhesins mediate adherence to Candida
              albicans, allowing C. glabrata to efficiently invade the oral
              epithelium and form robust biofilms. It is noteworthy that every

              adhere avidly to mammalian cells, an interaction that depends on
              the Epa1p lectin. EPA1 is shown here to be a member of a larger
              family of highly related genes encoded in subtelomeric clusters.
              Subtelomeric clustering of large families of surface
              glycoprotein-encoding genes is a hallmark of several pathogens,
              including Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, and Pneumocystis. In these
              other pathogens, a single surface glycoprotein is expressed,
              whereas other genes in the family are transcriptionally silent.
              Similarly, whereas EPA1 is expressed in vitro, EPA2-5 are
              transcriptionally repressed. This repression is shown to be due
              to regional silencing of the subtelomeric loci. In Saccharomyces

              characteristics unique to eukaryotic genomes. Genes residing in
              these loci are subject to epigenetic regulation and elevated
              rates of both meiotic and mitotic recombination. However, most
              genome sequences do not contain assembled subtelomeric sequences,
              and, as a result, subtelomeres are often overlooked in
              comparative genomics. RESULTS: We studied the evolution and
              functional divergence of subtelomeric gene families in the yeast
              lineage. Our computational results show that subtelomeric
              families are evolving and expanding much faster than families
              that do not contain subtelomeric genes. Focusing on three related
              subtelomeric MAL gene families involved in disaccharide

              evolution, we show experimentally how frequent duplication events
              followed by functional divergence yield novel alleles that allow
              the metabolism of different carbohydrates. CONCLUSIONS: Taken
              together, our computational and experimental analyses show that
              the extraordinary instability of eukaryotic subtelomeres supports
              rapid adaptation to novel niches by promoting gene recombination
