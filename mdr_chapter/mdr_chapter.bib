              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers
              at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one
              type of alignment. Availability and implementation:

              can explore the taxonomic profile and the function of unknown
              microorganisms in samples, and complement the shortage of
              amplicon sequencing. Binning assembled sequences into individual
              groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a
              major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and
              unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in
              binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters
              contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods
              without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot
              of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome
              tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In
              this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12
              original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing
              the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic
              datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. RESULTS: For
              chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat,
              Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner,
              and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the
              most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2
              achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (>
              0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among
              original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had
              similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity.
              Genome refining binners DASTool predicated the most high-quality
              genome bins among all genomes binners. Most genome binner
              performed well for unique strains. Nonetheless, reconstructing
              common strains still is a substantial challenge for all genome
              binner. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we tested a set of currently
              available, state-of-the-art metagenomics hybrid binning tools and
              provided a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic binning by

  abstract = "The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included
              within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in
              genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in
              2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including
              aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference
              genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome.
              Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make
              it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large
              sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we
              describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that
              addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix
              tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix
              array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing
              of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input
              size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any
              biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these
              enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to
              handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an
              alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to
              compute that the two species are 98\% identical across 96\% of
              their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can
              also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes,
              although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated
              read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called
              from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These
              improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment

              long-range contiguity information; thus, shotgun sequencing and
              de novo assembly of a metagenome typically yield a collection of
              contigs that cannot readily be grouped by species. Methods for
              generating chromatin-level contact probability maps, e.g., as

              endogenous epigenetic barcodes to resolve individual reads and
              assembled contigs into species- and strain-level bins. We
              validate our method using synthetic and real microbiome

              links plasmids and other mobile genetic elements to their host
              species in a real microbiome sample. Incorporation of DNA
              methylation information into shotgun metagenomics analyses will

  abstract = "So far, microbial physiology has dedicated itself mainly to pure
              cultures. In nature, cross feeding and competition are important
              aspects of microbial physiology and these can only be addressed
              by studying complete communities such as enrichment cultures.
              Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool to characterize such
              mixed cultures. In the analysis of metagenomic data, well
              established algorithms exist for the assembly of short reads into
              contigs and for the annotation of predicted genes. However, the
              binning of the assembled contigs or unassembled reads is still a
              major bottleneck and required to understand how the overall
              metabolism is partitioned over different community members.
              Binning consists of the clustering of contigs or reads that
              apparently originate from the same source population. In the
              present study eight metagenomic samples from the same habitat, a
              laboratory enrichment culture, were sequenced. Each sample
              contained 13-23 Mb of assembled contigs and up to eight abundant
              populations. Binning was attempted with existing methods but they
              were found to produce poor results, were slow, dependent on
              non-standard platforms or produced errors. A new binning
              procedure was developed based on multivariate statistics of
              tetranucleotide frequencies combined with the use of interpolated
              Markov models. Its performance was evaluated by comparison of the
              results between samples with BLAST and in comparison to existing
              algorithms for four publicly available metagenomes and one
              previously published artificial metagenome. The accuracy of the
              new approach was comparable or higher than existing methods.
              Further, it was up to a 100 times faster. It was implemented in
              Java Swing as a complete open source graphical binning
              application available for download and further development

              First, we benchmarked metaFlye using simulated and mock bacterial

              with better completeness and contiguity than state-of-the-art

              both read mapping and methylation calling in a single convenient
              step. Its output discriminates between cytosines in CpG, CHG and
              CHH context and enables bench scientists to visualize and
