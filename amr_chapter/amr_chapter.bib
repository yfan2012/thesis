  abstract  = "QnrB1 is a plasmid-encoded pentapeptide repeat protein (PRP)
               that confers a moderate degree of resistance to
               fluoroquinolones. Its gene was cloned into an expression vector
               with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, and the protein was
               purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The structure of
               QnrB1 was determined by a combination of trypsinolysis, surface
               mutagenesis, and single anomalous dispersion phasing. QnrB1
               folds as a right-handed quadrilateral $\beta$-helix with a
               highly asymmetric dimeric structure typical of PRP-topoisomerase
               poison resistance factors. The threading of pentapeptides into
               the $\beta$-helical fold is interrupted by two noncanonical PRP
               sequences that produce outward projecting loops that interrupt
               the regularity of the PRP surface. Deletion of the larger upper
               loop eliminated the protective effect of QnrB1 on DNA gyrase
               toward inhibition by quinolones, whereas deletion of the smaller
               lower loop drastically reduced the protective effect. These
               loops are conserved among all plasmid-based Qnr variants (QnrA,
               QnrC, QnrD, and QnrS) and some chromosomally encoded Qnr
               varieties. A mechanism in which PRP-topoisomerase poison
               resistance factors bind to and disrupt the quinolone-DNA-gyrase

              error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly
              of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains
              challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of
              Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy
              single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore
              sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves
              assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an
              order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2.
              These advances result from new overlapping and assembly
              algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on
              tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction
              that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We
              demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial
              genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either
              Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and
              achieves a contig NG50 of >21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila

               clinical setting to tailor antimicrobial prescribing and inform
               infection control outbreaks. A recent technological innovation
               that could reduce the delay between pathogen sampling and data
               generation is single molecule sequencing. An example of this
               technology, which is undergoing evaluation through an early
               access programme, is the Oxford Nanopore MinION. METHODS: We
               undertook a feasibility study on six clinically significant
               pathogens, comparing the MinION to the Illumina MiSeq and PacBio
               RSII platforms. Genomic DNA was prepared and sequenced using the
               MinION as instructed by the manufacturer, and Illumina MiSeq and
               PacBio sequencing was performed using established methods.
               RESULTS: An evaluation of the accuracy of the MinION based on
               sequencing of an MRSA isolate showed that error rates were
               higher in the MinION reads, but provided an even coverage across

               expected carbapenemases and ESBL genes in five Gram-negative

               clinical and epidemiological purposes. This retrospective study
               aimed to determine the efficacy of whole genome-based
               antimicrobial resistance prediction in clinical isolates of
               Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS:
               Seventy-four E. coli and 69 K. pneumoniae bacteraemia isolates
               from Oxfordshire, UK, were sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000).
               Resistance phenotypes were predicted from genomic sequences
               using BLASTn-based comparisons of de novo-assembled contigs with
               a study database of >100 known resistance-associated loci,
               including plasmid-associated and chromosomal genes. Predictions
               were made for seven commonly used antimicrobials: amoxicillin,
               co-amoxiclav, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin,
               gentamicin and meropenem. Comparisons were made with phenotypic
               results obtained in duplicate by broth dilution (BD Phoenix).
               Discrepancies, either between duplicate BD Phoenix results or
               between genotype and phenotype, were resolved with gradient
               diffusion analyses. RESULTS: A wide variety of antimicrobial
               resistance genes were identified, including blaCTX-M, blaLEN,
               blaOKP, blaOXA, blaSHV, blaTEM, aac(3')-Ia, aac-(3')-IId,

               across all antibiotics for both species was 0.96 (95\% CI:
               0.94-0.98) and the specificity was 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.95-0.98).

               cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem
               especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and
               Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to
               these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible
               plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which
               consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly
               expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia
               coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance
               due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than
               extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the
               world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum.
               AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are
               also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more
               efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC
               beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still
               evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory,
               which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism.
               Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to
               AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in
               some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane
               porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).",

               directly on clinical samples and to develop easy-to-use
               bioinformatic tools for the analysis of sequencing data.
               Thirty-five random urine samples from patients with suspected
               urinary tract infections were examined using conventional
               microbiology, WGS of isolated bacteria, and direct sequencing on
               pellets from the urine samples. A rapid method for analyzing the
               sequence data was developed. Bacteria were cultivated from 19
               samples but in pure cultures from only 17 samples. WGS improved
               the identification of the cultivated bacteria, and almost
               complete agreement was observed between phenotypic and predicted
               antimicrobial susceptibilities. Complete agreement was observed

               need for data analysis is still a hurdle to clinical
               implementation. To overcome this problem, a publicly available

               emergence of ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance during multidrug
               resistant (MDR)-Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are limited.
               Methods: We performed a retrospective study of 21 patients
               treated with ceftolozane-tazobactam for MDR-P. aeruginosa
               infections. Whole genome sequencing and quantitative real-time
               polymerase chain reaction were performed on longitudinal
               isolates. Results: Median age was 58 years; 9 patients (43\%)
               were transplant recipients. Median simplified acute physiology
               score-II (SAPS-II) was 26. Eighteen (86\%) patients were treated
               for respiratory tract infections; others were treated for
               bloodstream, complicated intraabdominal infections, or
               complicated urinary tract infections. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was
               discontinued in 1 patient (rash). Thirty-day all-cause and
               attributable mortality rates were 10\% (2/21) and 5\% (1/21),
               respectively; corresponding 90-day mortality rates were 48\%
               (10/21) and 19\% (4/21). The ceftolozane-tazobactam failure rate
               was 29\% (6/21). SAPS-II score was the sole predictor of
               failure. Ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance emerged in 3 (14\%)
               patients. Resistance was associated with de novo mutations,
               rather than acquisition of resistant nosocomial isolates. ampC
               overexpression and mutations were identified as potential
               resistance determinants. Conclusions: In this small study,
               ceftolozane-tazobactam was successful in treating 71\% of
               patients with MDR-P. aeruginosa infections, most of whom had
               pneumonia. The emergence of ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance in
               3 patients is worrisome and may be mediated in part by
               AmpC-related mechanisms. More research on treatment responses

               actionable information. Three software tools (PBcR, Canu and
               miniasm) were used to assemble MinION data and a fourth (SPAdes)
               was used to combine MinION and Illumina data to produce a hybrid
               assembly. All four had a similar number of contigs and were more
               contiguous than the assembly using Illumina data alone, with
               SPAdes producing a single chromosomal contig. Evaluation of the
               four assemblies to represent the genome structure revealed a
               single large inversion in the SPAdes assembly, which also
               incorrectly integrated a plasmid into the chromosomal contig.

               generated in 2 h using Canu, indicating that going from isolate
               to assembled data is possible in less than 48 h. MinION data
               identified that genes responsible for resistance were carried by

               third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, led by Pacific
               Biosciences (PacBio), is progressing rapidly, moving from a
               technology once only capable of providing data for small genome
               analysis, or for performing targeted screening, to one that
               promises high quality de novo assembly and structural variation
               detection for human-sized genomes. In 2014, the MinION, the
               first commercial sequencer using nanopore technology, was
               released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MinION
               identifies DNA bases by measuring the changes in electrical
               conductivity generated as DNA strands pass through a biological
               pore. Its portability, affordability, and speed in data
               production makes it suitable for real-time applications, the
               release of the long read sequencer MinION has thus generated
               much excitement and interest in the genomics community. While de
               novo genome assemblies can be cheaply produced from SGS data,
               assembly continuity is often relatively poor, due to the limited
               ability of short reads to handle long repeats. Assembly quality
               can be greatly improved by using TGS long reads, since
               repetitive regions can be easily expanded into using longer
               sequencing lengths, despite having higher error rates at the
               base level. The potential of nanopore sequencing has been
               demonstrated by various studies in genome surveillance at

               zone diameters of ciprofloxacin. Isolates with resistant,
               reduced-susceptible, and susceptible to fluoroquinolone were
               defined as CIP zone diameters of or = 27 mm, respectively. Thus,
               in addition to 38 (7\%) resistant isolates, there were 30
               (5.5\%) reduced-susceptible isolates and 473 (87.5\%)
               susceptible isolates. A total of 34 isolates consisting of nine
               resistant, 13 reduced-susceptible, and 12 susceptible isolates
               were assessed for point mutations in gyrA and parC and the outer
               membrane profiles. The susceptibility to fluoroquinolone of 13
               reduced-susceptible isolates was not altered in the presence of
               carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an efflux inhibitor,
               showing that efflux is not a major contributor to reduced
               susceptibility. In addition to single mutation in gyrA, OmpK35
               porin loss can also be the first step for developing
               fluoroquinolone resistance. No strain possesses a parC mutation
               without the simultaneous presence of a gyrA mutation, suggesting
               that mutations in parC play a complementary role for
               higher-level of fluoroquinolone resistance and fluoroquinolone
               resistance is a multistep process.",

               complexity. We explored whether MinION nanopore sequencing could
               accelerate diagnosis and resistance profiling, using complicated
               urinary tract infections as an exemplar. METHODS: Bacterial DNA
               was enriched from clinical urines (n = 10) and from healthy
               urines 'spiked' with multiresistant Escherichia coli (n = 5),
               then sequenced by MinION. Sequences were analysed using external
               databases and bioinformatic pipelines or, ultimately, using
               integrated real-time analysis applications. Results were
               compared with Illumina data and resistance phenotypes. RESULTS:
               MinION correctly identified pathogens without culture and, among
               55 acquired resistance genes detected in the cultivated bacteria
               by Illumina sequencing, 51 were found by MinION sequencing
               directly from the urines; with three of the four failures in an
               early run with low genome coverage. Resistance-conferring
               mutations and allelic variants were not reliably identified.
               CONCLUSIONS: MinION sequencing comprehensively identified
               pathogens and acquired resistance genes from urine in a
               timeframe similar to PCR (4 h from sample to result).
               Bioinformatic pipeline optimization is needed to better detect
               resistances conferred by point mutations.
               Metagenomic-sequencing-based diagnosis will enable clinicians to

               $\beta$-lactamases were originally relatively rare and always
               plasmid mediated. They had a substrate profile limited to the
               penicillins, but some became able to confer resistance to
               cephalosporins. From the 1980s onwards, isolates of
               Acinetobacter baumannii that were resistant to the carbapenems
               emerged, manifested by plasmid-encoded $\beta$-lactamases
               (OXA-23, OXA-40, and OXA-58) categorized as OXA enzymes because
               of their sequence similarity to earlier OXA $\beta$-lactamases.
               It was soon found that every A. baumannii strain possessed a
               chromosomally encoded OXA $\beta$-lactamase (OXA-51-like), some
               of which could confer resistance to carbapenems when the genetic
               environment around the gene promoted its expression. Similarly,

               possessed their own chromosomally encoded OXA

               Unfortunately, their efficacy has been reduced by the surge and
               dissemination of resistance. In some cases the levels of
               resistance reached the point that rendered them virtually
               useless. Among many known mechanisms of resistance to
               aminoglycosides, enzymatic modification is the most prevalent in
               the clinical setting. Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes catalyze
               the modification at different -OH or -NH₂ groups of the
               2-deoxystreptamine nucleus or the sugar moieties and can be
               nucleotidyltransferases, phosphotransferases, or
               acetyltransferases. The number of aminoglycoside modifying
               enzymes identified to date as well as the genetic environments
               where the coding genes are located is impressive and there is
               virtually no bacteria that is unable to support enzymatic

               overcome the action of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. Their

               antibiotics that have proven effective in the treatment of
               infections. These strategies consist of the development of

  abstract  = "Background: There is marked interest in using DNA-based methods
               to detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with targeted
               polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approaches increasingly being
               incorporated into clinical care. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
               could offer significant advantages over targeted PCR for AMR
               detection, particularly for species where mutations are major
               drivers of AMR. Methods: Illumina MiSeq WGS and broth
               microdilution (BMD) assays were performed on 90 bloodstream
               isolates of the 4 most common gram-negative bacteria causing
               bloodstream infections in neutropenic patients. The WGS data,
               including both gene presence/absence and detection of mutations
               in an array of AMR-relevant genes, were used to predict
               resistance to 4 $\beta$-lactams commonly used in the empiric
               treatment of neutropenic fever. The genotypic predictions were
               then compared to phenotypic resistance as determined by BMD and
               by commercial methods during routine patient care. Results: Of
               133 putative instances of resistance to the $\beta$-lactams of
               interest identified by WGS, only 87 (65\%) would have been
               detected by a typical PCR-based approach. The sensitivity,
               specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for WGS
               in predicting AMR were 0.87, 0.98, 0.97, and 0.91, respectively.
               Using BMD as the gold standard, our genotypic resistance
               prediction approach had a significantly higher positive
               predictive value compared to minimum inhibitory concentrations
               generated by commercial methods (0.97 vs 0.92; P = .025).
               Conclusions: These data demonstrate the potential feasibility of
               using WGS to guide antibiotic treatment decisions for patients

               review in 2001. Thirty-eight acquired tetracycline resistant
               (Tc(r)) genes are known of which nine are new and include five
               genes coding for energy-dependent efflux proteins, two genes
               coding for ribosomal protection proteins, and two genes coding
               for tetracycline inactivating enzymes. The number of
               inactivating enzymes has increased from one to three, suggesting
               that work needs to be done to determine the role these enzymes
               play in bacterial resistance to tetracycline. In the same time
               period, 66 new genera have been identified which carry one or
               more of the previously described 29 Tc(r) genes. Included in the
               new genera is, for the first time, an obligate intracellular

               capable of DNA exchange with non-obligate intracellular

              associated with considerable mortality. As mechanisms of
              carbapenem resistance are heterogeneous, it is unclear if
              mortality differs based on resistance mechanisms. We sought to
              determine whether CRE resistance mechanism determination is
              prognostically informative. METHODS: We conducted an
              observational study comparing 14-day mortality between patients
              with carbapenemase-producing (CP)-CRE compared with non-CP-CRE
              bacteremia. Clinical data were collected on all patients. A
              comprehensive DNA microarray-based assay was performed on all
              isolates to identify $\beta$-lactamase-encoding genes. RESULTS:
              There were 83 unique episodes of monomicrobial CRE bacteremia
              during the study period: 37 (45\%) CP-CRE and 46 (55\%)
              non-CP-CRE. The majority of CP-CRE isolates were bla KPC (92\%),
              followed by bla NDM (5\%) and bla OXA-48-type (3\%). CP-CRE
              isolates were more likely to have meropenem minimum inhibitory
              concentrations (MICs) $\geq$16 µg/mL, while non-CP-CRE isolates
              were more likely to have meropenem MICs $\leq$1 µg/mL (P value <
              .001). A total of 18 (22\%) patients died within 14 days,
              including 12 (32\%) in the CP-CRE group and 6 (13\%) in the
              non-CP-CRE group. Adjusting for severity of illness on day 1 of
              bacteremia, underlying medical conditions, and differences in
              antibiotic treatment administered, the odds of dying within 14
              days were more than 4 times greater for CP-CRE compared with
              non-CP-CRE bacteremic patients (adjusted odds ratio, 4.92; 95\%
              confidence interval, 1.01-24.81). CONCLUSION: Our findings
              suggest that CP-CRE may be more virulent than non-CP-CRE and are
              associated with poorer outcomes. This underscores the added

               become a major threat to modern medicine. The outcome of
               antibiotic treatment can be affected by the composition of the

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVES: Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes
                 is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and
                 the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of
                 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes
                 increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and
                 is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for
                 resistance gene identification. Thus, the current challenge is
                 to extract the relevant information from the large amount of
                 generated data. METHODS: We developed a web-based method,
                 ResFinder that uses BLAST for identification of acquired
                 antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input,
                 the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial
                 genomes, and short sequence reads from four different
                 sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank
                 files containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as
                 on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates. RESULTS: When testing the
                 1862 GenBank files, the method identified the resistance genes
                 with an ID = 100\% (100\% identity) to the genes in ResFinder.
                 Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing
                 was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of
                 five different bacterial species, with available phenotypes.
                 Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and
                 plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were
                 annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases,
                 annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results.
                 CONCLUSIONS: A web server providing a convenient way of
                 identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in
                 completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be
                 accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will

              ompK36 ($\Delta$ompK36) resulted in MIC shifts of cefazolin,

              the single deletion of ompK35 ($\Delta$ompK35) had no significant
              effect. A double deletion of ompK35 and ompK36
              ($\Delta$ompK35/36) further increased these MICs to high-level
              resistance and led to 8- and 16-fold increases in the MICs of
              meropenem and cefepime, respectively. In contrast to the routine
              testing medium, which is of high osmolarity, susceptibility tests
              using low-osmolarity medium showed that the $\Delta$ompK35
              mutation resulted in a significant ($\geq$ 4-fold) increase in
              the MICs of cefazolin and ceftazidime, whereas a $\Delta$ompK36
              deletion conferred a significantly (4-fold) lower increase in the
              MIC of cefazolin. In the virulence assays, a significant (P <
              0.05) defect in the growth rate was found only in the
              $\Delta$ompK35/36 mutant, indicating the effect on metabolic
              fitness. A significant (P < 0.05) increase in susceptibility to
              neutrophil phagocytosis was observed in both $\Delta$ompK36 and
              $\Delta$ompK35/36 mutants. In a mouse peritonitis model, the
              $\Delta$ompK35 mutant showed no change in virulence, and the
              $\Delta$ompK36 mutant exhibited significantly (P < 0.01) lower
              virulence, whereas the $\Delta$ompK35/36 mutant presented the

              mechanisms contributing to the variability in carbapenem MICs, 20
              clinical isolates, all belonging to either of two clonal groups
              of KPC-possessing K. pneumoniae endemic to New York City, were
              examined. Expression of genes encoding KPC, the porins OmpK35 and
              OmpK36, and the efflux pump AcrAB was examined by real-time
              RT-PCR. Outer-membrane profiles of selected KPC-producing
              isolates were examined by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were identified
              by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.
              The identification of SHV and TEM beta-lactamases and the genomic
              sequences of ompK35 and ompK36 were determined by PCR and DNA
              sequencing, respectively. For one clonal group, carbapenem MICs
              increased with decreasing expression of ompK36. A second clonal
              group also had carbapenem MICs that correlated with ompK36

              conclusion, isolates of KPC-possessing K. pneumoniae that express
              ompK36 tend to have lower MICs to carbapenems and therefore may
              be more difficult to detect by clinical laboratories. Regardless
              of ompK36 expression, all of the KPC producers were consistently
              resistant to ertapenem.",

              OmpK35 and OmpK36 porins in Klebsiella pneumoniae on the activity
              of two common plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes. METHODS: Naturally
              occurring conjugative plasmids containing bla(DHA-1) and
              bla(CMY-2) were obtained from K. pneumoniae isolates in western
              Sydney. These were moved into K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 and
              isogenic porin knockouts Kp885 (DeltaompK35) and Kp886
              (DeltaompK36), created by homologous recombination of kanamycin
              resistance cartridges into the specified genes, and their
              antimicrobial susceptibilities compared. RESULTS: beta-lactam
              resistance was greater in the presence of CMY-2-containing
              plasmids than DHA-1-containing plasmids, and higher in K.
              pneumoniae than Escherichia coli. Neither cefepime nor imipenem
              resistance was observed, and DHA-mediated cefotaxime and
              ticarcillin/clavulanate resistance was unexpectedly reduced from
              8-24 (CTX) and >256 (TIM) mg/L in Kp13883 to 1-2 (CTX) and 32-48
              mg/L (TIM) in the isogenic DeltaompK36 porin knockout Kp886.
              CONCLUSIONS: AmpC plasmids in particular are an important cause
              of transmissible resistance to ticarcillin/clavulanate in K.

              OmpK35 and OmpK36 porins in K. pneumoniae do not significantly
              increase antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae, and a
              paradoxical lowering of resistance to CTX and TIM is seen with
              deletion of ompK36. This has potentially important clinical
              implications.",

              quinolone modification (AAC(6')-Ib-cr), plasmid-encoded efflux
              systems (e.g. QepA or OqxAB, amongst others), effect on bacterial

              only result in a slight increase in the minimum inhibitory
              concentrations of quinolones, they possess an additive effect and
              may facilitate the acquisition of full quinolone resistance. The

  abstract = "The increased use of fluoroquinolones has led to increasing
              resistance to these antimicrobials, with rates of resistance that
              vary by both organism and geographic region. Resistance to
              fluoroquinolones typically arises as a result of alterations in
              the target enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) and of
              changes in drug entry and efflux. Mutations are selected first in
              the more susceptible target: DNA gyrase, in gram-negative
              bacteria, or topoisomerase IV, in gram-positive bacteria.
              Additional mutations in the next most susceptible target, as well
              as in genes controlling drug accumulation, augment resistance
              further, so that the most-resistant isolates have mutations in
              several genes. Resistance to quinolones can also be mediated by
              plasmids that produce the Qnr protein, which protects the
              quinolone targets from inhibition. Qnr plasmids have been found
              in the United States, Europe, and East Asia. Although Qnr by
              itself produces only low-level resistance, its presence
              facilitates the selection of higher-level resistance mutations,
              thus contributing to the alarming increase in resistance to
              quinolones.",
