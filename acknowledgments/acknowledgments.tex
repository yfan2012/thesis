\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I have tremendous gratitude \\
to those people, \\
numerous and uncountable, \\
who have contributed, \\
directly or in subtler ways, \\
to this work.

Some of them are listed here. \\

\textbf{To my advisor, Winston:} I remember writing to you as a sophomore in college many years ago, asking to do research in your brand new lab, which at the time was but a few months old. Back then, I hardly knew what research was and had no relevant skills or credentials to offer, only my time and my interest to learn. Over these years I've learned so much from you, and will always be grateful to you for building the place where I was able to grow.

\textbf{To my thesis committee, Trish and Steven:} Thank you for your patient guidance, encouragement, advice, and for helping me to keep an eye on the bigger picture.

\textbf{To the @yfan arc of the \texttt{\#}core channel - @isac, @brochael, @shao, @gilfunk, @narley, @broham, @gmoney, @Brittany, @sherbear, @Sam Sholes, @Paul Hook, @amymeltzer39, and @alice:} Thank you for those times when you patiently watched over me as I learned new lab techniques, answered my dumb questions, and generally saved me from my own buffoonery. Thank you even more for commiserating with me as we struggled together through the singular challenges of research, and celebrating the equally singular triumphs.

\textbf{To the crew that moved me into Boonique, and Charles, and Charlotte, and Sven, and Manolo:} Thanks for being there.

\textbf{To mom and dad, and family further away:} It was your labor that first cultivated my growth. Accomplishments in my name are as much yours as they are mine. I flourish for you.
