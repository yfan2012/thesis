  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The size and complexity of conifer genomes has, until
              now, prevented full genome sequencing and assembly. The large
              research community and economic importance of loblolly pine,
              Pinus taeda L., made it an early candidate for reference sequence
              determination. RESULTS: We develop a novel strategy to sequence
              the genome of loblolly pine that combines unique aspects of pine
              reproductive biology and genome assembly methodology. We use a
              whole genome shotgun approach relying primarily on next
              generation sequence generated from a single haploid seed
              megagametophyte from a loblolly pine tree, 20-1010, that has been
              used in industrial forest tree breeding. The resulting sequence
              and assembly was used to generate a draft genome spanning 23.2
              Gbp and containing 20.1 Gbp with an N50 scaffold size of 66.9
              kbp, making it a significant improvement over available conifer
              genomes. The long scaffold lengths allow the annotation of 50,172
              gene models with intron lengths averaging over 2.7 kbp and
              sometimes exceeding 100 kbp in length. Analysis of orthologous
              gene sets identifies gene families that may be unique to
              conifers. We further characterize and expand the existing repeat
              library based on the de novo analysis of the repetitive content,
              estimated to encompass 82\% of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: In
              addition to its value as a resource for researchers and breeders,
              the loblolly pine genome sequence and assembly reported here
              demonstrates a novel approach to sequencing the large and complex
              genomes of this important group of plants that can now be widely
              applied.",

              Assembly of metagenome sequences does not output whole genomes,
              so computational binning methods have been developed to cluster
              sequences into genome 'bins'. These methods exploit sequence
              composition, species abundance, or chromosome organization but
              cannot fully distinguish closely related species and strains. We
              present a binning method that incorporates bacterial DNA
              methylation signatures, which are detected using single-molecule

              method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the
              ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms
              in a human sample. However, complete and accurate
              characterization of the sequence, including identification of any
              pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for
              comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these
              numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis
              should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the
              presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used
              for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong
              pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a
              bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as
              low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of
              eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and

              use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We
              demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in
